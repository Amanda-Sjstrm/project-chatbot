# Project Name

Technigo project: Chatbot

The assignment was to create a chatbot in order to learn the fundamental syntax and concepts of JavaScript.

## The problem

Since this was my first experience with JavaScript it was challenging to understand how all the parts of the code were connected and how to activate one bot-reply after another. I decided to make it quite simple just to understand and learn the basics.
